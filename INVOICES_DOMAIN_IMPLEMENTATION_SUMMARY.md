## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Schema
```
invoices (id, invoice_number, supplier, total_amount_pennies, ...)
├── invoice_line_items (invoice_id, item, qty, unit_price_pennies, ...)
├── issues (invoice_id, issue_type, severity, status, ...)
├── pairings (invoice_id, delivery_note_id, similarity_score, ...)
└── audit_log (entity_type, entity_id, action, user_id, ...)

uploaded_files (id, original_filename, file_type, ...)
delivery_notes (id, delivery_number, supplier, ...)
```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Multi-Invoice PDF Support**
   - Automatically detects and splits multi-invoice PDFs
   - Creates separate invoice records for each document
   - Maintains file relationships

2. **Issue Detection & Management**
   - Automatic issue detection on upload
   - Types: `total_mismatch`, `price_mismatch`, `qty_mismatch`, `unit_math_suspect`
   - Severity levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`
   - RBAC-protected resolution and escalation

3. **Pairing Suggestions**
   - Automatic pairing suggestions based on similarity
   - Supplier matching, date proximity, line similarity
   - Role-protected confirmation/rejection

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Every mutation is logged with user, action, timestamp
   - Immutable audit trail
   - Entity-level tracking

5. **RBAC & Licensing**
   - Role-based access control (GM, Finance, Shift Lead)
   - License status checking (full vs limited mode)
   - Mutation blocking in limited mode

## 🚀 Key Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app/db_migrations.py` - Database migrations and schema management
- `app/enhanced_file_processor.py` - Complete upload and OCR pipeline
- `app/enhanced_invoices_page.py` - Full-featured invoices page
- `app/components.py` - Reusable UI components
- `scripts/smoke_test_invoices.py` - Comprehensive testing
- `scripts/acceptance_checklist.py` - Validation framework

### Enhanced Files
- `app/database.py` - Added business logic and audit functions

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Split Layout Design
- **Left Column**: Invoice cards with upload panel
- **Right Column**: Unmatched delivery notes + flagged issues summary
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Invoice Cards
- **Header**: Supplier, invoice number, date, total, status badge
- **Confidence**: Visual confidence indicators with color coding
- **Expandable**: Detailed view with line items, issues, pairing suggestions
- **Debug Tools**: Retry OCR for low-confidence invoices

### Upload Experience
- **Drag & Drop**: Multi-file upload support
- **Progress**: Real-time processing status
- **Role Protection**: GM/Finance only with license checks
- **Immediate Feedback**: Success/error notifications

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### RBAC Implementation
- **GM Role**: Full access to all invoice operations
- **Finance Role**: Invoice management and issue resolution
- **Shift Lead Role**: Limited access (as per requirements)

### Audit Trail
- **Complete Logging**: Every create/update/delete operation
- **User Attribution**: All actions tied to user ID
- **Immutable**: Audit log cannot be modified
- **Timestamped**: ISO format timestamps for all events

### Data Integrity
- **Monetary Precision**: All amounts stored in pennies
- **Foreign Keys**: Proper referential integrity
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error recovery

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- Supplier, status, and date indexes on invoices
- Invoice ID and flagged status indexes on line items
- Entity and timestamp indexes on audit log
- Pairing status and invoice ID indexes

### Efficient Queries
- Optimized joins for invoice details
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Lazy loading for complex relationships

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met

### ✅ Invoices page shows real DB data
### ✅ Issues appear, can be resolved/escalated with RBAC enforced
### ✅ Pairing suggestions appear and can be confirmed/rejected
### ✅ Audit log entries created for every action
### ✅ Limited Mode blocks mutations but UI still visible (tooltip explains)
### ✅ Smoke test passes with invoices routes working
