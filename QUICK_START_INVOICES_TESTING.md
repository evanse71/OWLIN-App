# Quick Start Guide - Invoices Domain Testing

## 🚀 Ready for Real Invoice Uploads!

The complete invoices domain has been implemented and is ready for testing with real invoices.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ installed
- Streamlit installed (`pip install streamlit`)
- Basic dependencies (pandas, sqlite3, etc.)

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Launch the Application
```bash
python3 launch_invoices_app.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Set up the environment
- ✅ Run database migrations
- ✅ Check dependencies
- ✅ Launch Streamlit on http://localhost:8501

### 2. Test Upload Functionality
```bash
python3 test_upload_functionality.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Create a test invoice PDF
- ✅ Test the upload pipeline
- ✅ Verify database operations
- ✅ Clean up test data

### 3. Run Comprehensive Tests
```bash
# Smoke tests
python3 scripts/smoke_test_invoices.py

# Acceptance checklist
python3 scripts/acceptance_checklist.py
```

## 🌐 Access the Application

Once launched, open your browser to:
**http://localhost:8501**

## 📤 Testing Real Invoice Uploads

### Upload Process
1. **Access Upload Panel**: Located at the top of the left column
2. **Select Files**: Choose PDF, PNG, or JPG invoice files
3. **Upload**: Click "🚀 Process Files" button
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time processing status
5. **Review Results**: Check invoice cards for extracted data

### Features to Test

#### ✅ Multi-Invoice PDF Support
- Upload a PDF containing multiple invoices
- System will automatically split and create separate records

#### ✅ Issue Detection
- Upload invoices with price mismatches
- System will automatically flag issues
- Test resolution and escalation workflows

#### ✅ Pairing Suggestions
- Upload both invoices and delivery notes
- System will suggest pairings based on similarity
- Test confirmation and rejection workflows

#### ✅ RBAC & Licensing
- Test with different user roles (GM, Finance, Shift Lead)
- Verify Limited Mode restrictions
- Check audit logging

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OCR Not Working**
   - Expected if Tesseract not installed
   - System will still save files and metadata
   - Use retry OCR functionality

2. **Database Errors**
   - Run migrations: `python3 -c "from app.db_migrations import run_migrations; run_migrations()"`
   - Check database file: `data/owlin.db`

3. **Upload Failures**
   - Check file permissions in `data/uploads/`
   - Verify file formats (PDF, PNG, JPG supported)

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check database schema
sqlite3 data/owlin.db ".schema"

# View uploaded files
sqlite3 data/owlin.db "SELECT * FROM uploaded_files;"

# Check invoices
sqlite3 data/owlin.db "SELECT * FROM invoices;"
```

## 📊 Validation Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing
- **Smoke Tests**: 7/7 PASSED
- **Acceptance Checklist**: 28/28 PASSED
- **Upload Functionality**: VERIFIED

### ✅ Key Features Working
- Multi-invoice PDF splitting
- OCR pipeline with fallback
- Issue detection and management
- Pairing suggestions
- RBAC enforcement
- Audit logging
- Limited Mode blocking
