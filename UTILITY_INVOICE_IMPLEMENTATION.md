# Utility Invoice and Multi-Invoice PDF Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds support for utility/service invoices that don't require delivery notes, and multi-invoice PDFs that contain multiple separate invoices in a single file.

## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. Utility Invoice Classification

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `delivery_note_required` column to the `invoices` table
- Created `classify_utility_invoice()` function in `backend/routes/ocr.py`
- Updated invoice creation to include utility classification
- Modified upload endpoint to handle utility invoices

**Frontend Changes:**
- Added utility invoice badges to `InvoiceCard` and `DocumentCard` components
- Updated `InvoicesUploadPanel` to pass utility invoice props
- Added visual indicators for service invoices

### 2. Multi-Invoice PDF Support

**Backend Changes:**
- Created `detect_multiple_invoices()` function in `backend/routes/ocr.py`
- Updated PDF processing to detect and handle multiple invoices
- Modified upload endpoint to process each detected invoice separately
- Added support for multiple invoice IDs in response

**Frontend Changes:**
- Added multiple invoice badges to display invoice count
- Updated components to show "Invoice 1/3 from PDF" style indicators

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Update

```sql
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN delivery_note_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

### Utility Invoice Classification Logic

The system classifies utility invoices based on:

1. **Supplier Name Keywords:**
   - Electricity: "electricity", "energy", "power"
   - Gas: "gas", "british gas", "edf energy"
   - Water: "water", "thames water", "severn trent"
   - Telecom: "telecom", "telephone", "bt", "sky", "virgin"
   - Insurance: "insurance", "insurer", "policy"
   - Services: "subscription", "membership", "rent", "licensing"

2. **Text Content Indicators:**
   - Service charges, utility bills, energy bills
   - Insurance premiums, subscription fees
   - Absence of delivery-related terms

3. **Heuristic Analysis:**
   - Few delivery terms + multiple billing terms = service invoice

### Multi-Invoice Detection Logic

The system detects multiple invoices by analyzing each PDF page for:

1. **Invoice Indicators:**
   - Invoice number, invoice date, billing date
   - Multiple indicators per page suggest separate invoice

2. **Supplier Patterns:**
   - Company names at page top
   - Energy, telecom, insurance company patterns

3. **Total Amount Patterns:**
   - Total amounts at page bottom
   - Currency and amount formatting

4. **Page Structure:**
   - Long pages with invoice indicators
   - Complete invoice structure per page

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend UI Enhancements

### Utility Invoice Badges

```tsx
{isUtilityInvoice && (
  <div className="bg-gray-100 text-gray-600 text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
    ðŸ§¾ Service Invoice â€¢ No Delivery Note Needed
  </div>
)}
```

### Multiple Invoice Badges

```tsx
{multipleInvoices && invoiceCount > 1 && (
  <div className="bg-blue-100 text-blue-600 text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
    ðŸ“„ Invoice 1/3 from PDF
  </div>
)}
```

### Delivery Note Status Display

```tsx
{!isUtilityInvoice && (
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
    Delivery Note: {deliveryNoteRequired ? 'Required' : 'Not Required'}
  </p>
)}
```

## ðŸ“Š API Response Changes

### Single Invoice Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "file_id": "uuid",
  "invoice_id": "uuid",
  "multiple_invoices": false,
  "is_utility_invoice": true,
  "delivery_note_required": false,
  "parsed_data": {
    "supplier_name": "British Gas",
    "delivery_note_required": false
  }
}
```

### Multiple Invoice Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "file_id": "uuid",
  "invoice_count": 3,
  "invoice_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "multiple_invoices": true,
  "message": "Successfully processed 3 invoices from single PDF"
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `test_utility_invoices.py`:

### Test Cases Covered

1. **Utility Invoice Classification:**
   - British Gas (energy) âœ…
   - EDF Energy (electricity) âœ…
   - BT (telecom) âœ…
   - Aviva Insurance âœ…
   - Fresh Foods Ltd (standard) âœ…

2. **Multi-Invoice Detection:**
   - 3-page PDF with 2 invoices âœ…
   - Page analysis and indicator counting âœ…
   - Supplier and total detection âœ…

3. **Upload Integration:**
   - File creation and validation âœ…
   - OCR processing setup âœ…

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Utility Invoice Upload

1. Upload electricity bill PDF
2. System automatically detects as utility invoice
3. Shows "ðŸ§¾ Service Invoice â€“ No Delivery Note Needed" badge
4. Skips delivery note matching
5. Invoice marked as `delivery_note_required: false`

### Multi-Invoice PDF Upload

1. Upload PDF with 3 separate invoices
2. System detects multiple invoices per page
3. Creates separate invoice records for each
4. Shows "ðŸ“„ Invoice 1/3 from PDF" badges
5. Returns array of invoice IDs

### Frontend Display

```tsx
<DocumentCard
  document={invoice}
  isUtilityInvoice={invoice.parsedData?.delivery_note_required === false}
  deliveryNoteRequired={invoice.parsedData?.delivery_note_required !== false}
  multipleInvoices={invoice.multipleInvoices}
  invoiceCount={invoice.invoiceCount}
/>
```

## ðŸ”„ Auto-Matching Logic

### Standard Invoices
- Attempt to match with delivery notes
- Show "Delivery Note: Required" status
- Flag for manual review if no match found

### Utility Invoices
- Skip delivery note matching entirely
- Show "Delivery Note: Not Required" status
- Mark as complete immediately

### Multi-Invoice PDFs
- Process each invoice independently
- Apply utility classification per invoice
- Handle matching per individual invoice

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits

   - Clear visual indicators for different invoice types
   - Reduced confusion about delivery note requirements
   - Better handling of complex PDFs

2. **Automated Processing:**
   - No manual intervention needed for utility invoices
   - Automatic detection of multi-invoice PDFs
   - Reduced processing time for service invoices

3. **Data Accuracy:**
   - Proper classification prevents false matching attempts
   - Accurate delivery note requirement flags
   - Better invoice organization and tracking

4. **Scalability:**
   - Handles bulk utility invoices efficiently
   - Supports complex multi-page documents
   - Extensible classification system

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

   - Machine learning-based utility detection
   - Supplier database with automatic classification
   - Industry-specific keyword expansion

2. **Advanced Multi-Invoice Support:**
   - Sub-page invoice detection
