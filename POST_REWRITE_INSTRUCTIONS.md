# Post-History-Rewrite Instructions

## For All Collaborators

Due to the comprehensive security and quality hardening performed on this repository, the Git history was rewritten to remove sensitive files and optimize the repository. **All collaborators must realign their local repositories.**

### Required Steps

```bash
# 1. Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# 2. Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# 3. Reset to match remote exactly
git reset --hard origin/main

# 4. Clean up old objects
git gc --prune=now
```

### What Changed

- ✅ **Security**: All sensitive files (DBs, logs, backups) removed from history
- ✅ **Quality**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- ✅ **Database**: Foreign key constraints enforced, orphaned records cleaned
- ✅ **API**: Bulletproof endpoints with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Frontend**: Type-safe, linted, builds successfully

### New CI Pipeline

The repository now has comprehensive CI that runs on every push/PR:
- Python FK enforcement tests
- Frontend type-check, lint, and build validation
- API smoke tests with real server startup
- Sensitive file pattern blocking

### Branch Protection

Main branch now requires:
- Pull request reviews
- CI to pass
- No force pushes
