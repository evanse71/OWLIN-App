# File Preview Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete file preview system for the OWLIN application, allowing users to view and preview uploaded invoice files through both API endpoints and a web interface.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. FastAPI Routes Added to `backend/routes/upload_fixed.py`

#### File Listing Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/files")
def list_uploaded_files():
    """List all uploaded files with their metadata."""
```
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all uploaded files from the database with metadata
- **Response**: JSON object containing array of files with:
  - File ID, filename, upload timestamp
  - Invoice number, supplier name, total amount
  - Status, confidence score, preview URL
- **Database**: Uses `invoices` table with `parent_pdf_filename` column

#### File Preview Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/files/{document_id}/preview")
def preview_file(document_id: str):
    """Preview a specific uploaded file by document ID."""
```
- **Purpose**: Serves actual file content for preview/download
- **Features**:
  - Validates file exists in database
  - Checks file type (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG only)
  - Returns file as `FileResponse` with proper headers
  - Error handling for missing files or unsupported types
- **Security**: Only allows specific file extensions for preview

### 2. Database Integration
- **Table**: `invoices` table with `parent_pdf_filename` column
- **Sample Data**: Created test script to populate database with sample invoices
- **File Storage**: Files stored in `data/uploads/` directory
- **Static Files**: FastAPI serves preview images from `data/previews/`

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. File Preview Page (`pages/file-preview.tsx`)
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- **Features**:
  - Grid layout showing all uploaded files
  - File metadata display (invoice number, supplier, amount, etc.)
  - Status badges with color coding
  - Preview and download buttons
  - Modal preview with iframe
  - Error handling and loading states

### 2. Key Components
- **File Cards**: Display file information in organized cards
- **Preview Modal**: Overlay with iframe for inline preview
- **Download Functionality**: Direct file download capability
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## API Endpoints

### 1. List Files
```
GET /api/files
```
**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "958a1f15-3def-447d-bf10-e16d7c0cfc37",
      "filename": "dd909fa7-459e-4abf-9be8-c5df408e30f5.pdf",
      "upload_timestamp": "2024-07-28T11:46:00",
      "invoice_number": "INV-001",
      "supplier_name": "Supplier 1",
      "total_amount": 100.0,
      "status": "processed",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "preview_url": "/api/files/958a1f15-3def-447d-bf10-e16d7c0cfc37/preview"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Preview File
```
GET /api/files/{document_id}/preview
```
**Response**: File content with appropriate headers for browser display/download

## Testing

### 1. Test Script (`test_file_preview.py`)
- **Database Population**: Adds sample invoice data to database
- **API Testing**: Tests both listing and preview endpoints
- **Verification**: Confirms endpoints return correct responses

### 2. Manual Testing
- ✅ File listing endpoint returns correct data
- ✅ File preview endpoint serves actual PDF content
- ✅ Frontend page loads and displays files
- ✅ Preview functionality works in browser
- ✅ Download functionality works correctly

## Security Features

### 1. File Type Validation
- Only allows specific extensions: `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
- Prevents access to potentially dangerous file types

### 2. Database Validation
- Verifies file exists in database before serving
- Prevents direct file system access

### 3. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for missing files
- Graceful handling of database errors
- User-friendly error display in frontend

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Access File Preview Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/file-preview`

### 2. View Files
- Page displays all uploaded files in a grid
- Each file shows metadata and status
- Files are sorted by upload date (newest first)

### 3. Preview Files
- Click "Preview" button to open file in new tab
- Click download button (⬇️) to download file directly
- Modal preview available for inline viewing

### 4. API Usage
```bash
# List all files
curl http://localhost:8000/api/files

# Preview specific file
curl http://localhost:8000/api/files/{document_id}/preview
```

## Technical Details

### 1. File Storage
- **Location**: `data/uploads/`
- **Naming**: UUID-based filenames for security
- **Database**: File references stored in `invoices.parent_pdf_filename`

### 2. Performance
- **Caching**: Static file serving for preview images
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries
- **Responsive UI**: Fast loading with loading states

### 3. Error Handling
- **Backend**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Frontend**: User-friendly error messages
- **Database**: Graceful handling of missing records

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional Features
- File search and filtering
- Bulk download functionality
- File versioning support
- Advanced preview options (zoom, rotate)

### 2. Security Improvements
- User authentication for file access
- File encryption
- Audit logging for file access

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- File compression for large documents
- Thumbnail generation for faster preview
- CDN integration for static files

## Conclusion

The file preview system is now fully functional and provides:
- ✅ Complete backend API implementation
- ✅ Modern, responsive frontend interface
- ✅ Secure file access with validation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Easy-to-use interface for end users

The implementation follows best practices for security, performance, and user experience, making it ready for production use.
