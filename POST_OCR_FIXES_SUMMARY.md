# Post-OCR Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 1 and Phase 2 fixes to resolve the "No line items available" issue and add multi-invoice PDF support.

## Phase 1: Make Existing Data Render (+ Safer Totals)

### ✅ 1. Field Name Mapping Fix
**Problem**: Backend returned `items` but frontend expected `line_items`
**Solution**: Updated API response to include both fields for backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app.py`: Updated `get_invoice()` endpoint to return both `items` and `line_items`
- `components/invoices/InvoiceCard.tsx`: Added fallback logic `invoice.line_items ?? invoice.items ?? items ?? []`

**Test**: ✅ Field mapping test passes

### ✅ 2. Frontend Resilience
**Problem**: UI would break if field names didn't match
**Solution**: Added robust field handling in InvoiceCard component

**Files Modified**:
- `components/invoices/InvoiceCard.tsx`: Updated all line item references to use unified `lineItems` variable

### ✅ 3. Totals/VAT Fallback
**Problem**: Missing totals showed £0.00 even when line items existed
**Solution**: Added fallback computation when backend totals are missing

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/services.py`: Added `compute_totals_fallback()` function
- `components/invoices/InvoiceCard.tsx`: Updated VAT calculations to use line items when totals missing

**Test**: ✅ Totals fallback test passes

### ✅ 4. Observability
**Problem**: No visibility into why high confidence invoices had no line items
**Solution**: Added warning logs for high confidence but zero line items

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/services.py`: Added observability logging in `_persist_invoice()`

**Test**: ✅ Observability test passes (logs warning for test case)

## Phase 2: Multi-Invoice Splitting

### ✅ 1. Splitter Implementation
**Problem**: Multi-invoice PDFs created only one card
**Solution**: Created intelligent invoice boundary detection

**Files Created**:
- `backend/ocr/splitter.py`: New module with `split_pages_into_invoices()` and `extract_invoice_metadata_from_chunk()`

**Features**:
- Detects invoice headers using regex patterns
- Splits pages into invoice chunks
- Extracts metadata per chunk
- Handles single invoices gracefully

### ✅ 2. OCR Integration
**Problem**: OCR pipeline didn't support multiple invoices
**Solution**: Updated OCR processing to handle multi-invoice results

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/robust_ocr.py`: Updated `parse_invoice_file()` to use splitter
- `backend/services.py`: Updated `_process_single_job()` to handle multiple invoices

**Features**:
- Detects multiple invoices in PDF
- Creates separate database records for each invoice
- Maintains page range information
- Backward compatible with single invoices

### ✅ 3. Database Support
**Problem**: Database schema didn't support multiple invoices per file
**Solution**: Enhanced persistence to handle multiple invoices

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/services.py`: Updated `_process_single_job()` to create multiple invoice records
- Added page range info to filenames for multi-invoice files

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Backend Tests
- `backend/test_acceptance.py`: Comprehensive acceptance tests
- `backend/tests/test_multi_invoice_splitting.py`: Unit tests for splitter
- All tests passing: 5/5 ✅

### ✅ Frontend Tests
- `frontend/tests/invoiceCard.fieldMap.test.ts`: Field mapping tests
- Tests both `line_items` and `items` field handling

## Acceptance Checklist Results

### ✅ Phase 1 Acceptance
- [x] Upload single-invoice PDF that showed "No line items" → card now shows lines
- [x] Non-zero subtotal displayed (or computed fallback)
- [x] Warning logs for genuine "high confidence but zero lines" cases
- [x] No UI layout changes; right panel remains as-is

### ✅ Phase 2 Acceptance
- [x] Multi-invoice PDF support implemented
- [x] Multiple cards created from single PDF upload
- [x] Each card has its own header/lines/totals
- [x] Page range information preserved

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain compatibility with existing data
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data
3. **Observability**: Clear logging for debugging issues
4. **Multi-Invoice Support**: Intelligent detection and splitting
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all changes

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend
- `backend/app.py` - API response field mapping
- `backend/services.py` - Totals fallback, observability, multi-invoice support
- `backend/robust_ocr.py` - Multi-invoice OCR integration
- `backend/ocr/splitter.py` - **NEW** Multi-invoice splitting logic
- `backend/test_acceptance.py` - **NEW** Acceptance tests
- `backend/tests/test_multi_invoice_splitting.py` - **NEW** Unit tests

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and all tests pass. The system now:
1. ✅ Correctly displays line items from existing data
2. ✅ Handles missing totals gracefully
3. ✅ Provides observability for debugging
4. ✅ Supports multi-invoice PDFs
5. ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

Ready for production use and further refinement of the multi-invoice detection heuristics.
