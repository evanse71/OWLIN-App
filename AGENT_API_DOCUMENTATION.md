## üß™ **Testing**

### Manual Testing with curl

**Test basic agent ask:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/agent/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_prompt": "What should I do about this invoice?",
    "user_id": "test_user_123",
    "invoice_id": "INV-73318",
    "role": "gm"
  }'
```

**Test health check:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/agent/health"
```

**Test capabilities:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/agent/capabilities"
```

### Automated Testing
Run the test script:
```bash
python3 test_agent_api.py
```

## üîß **Integration Examples**

### Frontend Integration (JavaScript)
```javascript
// Ask the agent a question
async function askAgent(userPrompt, userId, invoiceId, role) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/agent/ask', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            user_prompt: userPrompt,
            user_id: userId,
            invoice_id: invoiceId,
            role: role
        })
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    // Display the response
    console.log('Agent response:', result.markdown);
    console.log('Confidence:', result.confidence);
    console.log('Suggested actions:', result.actions);
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
askAgent(
    "Why is this invoice more expensive than usual?",
    "user_123",
    "INV-73318",
    "gm"
);
```

### Python Integration
```python
import requests

def ask_agent(user_prompt, user_id, invoice_id, role):
    url = "http://localhost:8000/api/agent/ask"
    payload = {
        "user_prompt": user_prompt,
        "user_id": user_id,
        "invoice_id": invoice_id,
        "role": role
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
result = ask_agent(
    "What should I do about this invoice?",
    "user_123",
    "INV-73318",
    "gm"
)

print(f"Agent response: {result['markdown']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}%")
```

## üöÄ **Usage Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Invoice Review
1. User opens an invoice
2. User types: "Why is this more expensive than usual?"
3. Frontend sends to `/api/agent/ask`
4. Agent responds with analysis and suggestions
5. Frontend displays response and suggested actions

### Scenario 2: Credit Request
1. User flags an item on an invoice
2. User asks: "Can I get a credit for this?"
3. Frontend sends to `/api/agent/suggest-credit`
4. Agent calculates credit amount and provides reasoning
5. Frontend shows credit suggestion with action buttons

### Scenario 3: Email Generation
1. User wants to contact supplier about an issue
2. User clicks "Generate Email" button
3. Frontend sends to `/api/agent/generate-email`
4. Agent creates professional email draft
5. Frontend displays email for user to review and send

## üîí **Error Handling**

All endpoints return consistent error responses:
```json
{
    "error": "Error message",
    "markdown": "‚ö†Ô∏è The agent encountered an error. Please try again.",
    "actions": [],
    "confidence": 0,
    "entities": {},
    "urgency": "low"
}
```

## üìà **Performance**

- **Response Time:** Typically 1-3 seconds for agent responses
- **Fallback:** Automatic fallback responses when AI models are unavailable
- **Caching:** Client-side caching recommended for repeated questions
- **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Frontend Integration:** Connect the API endpoints to the React frontend
2. **Authentication:** Add user authentication and authorization
3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for production
4. **Monitoring:** Add metrics and monitoring for agent performance
5. **Caching:** Implement response caching for common questions
