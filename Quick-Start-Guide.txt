Troubleshooting Quickies:

*   Page looks old: Press Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh) in your browser.
*   Demo data shows: Close all terminal windows, then re-run a 'Start-Owlin-*.bat' script.
*   403 on dev endpoints: Ensure you are running the backend with OWLIN_ENV=dev (the scripts handle this).
*   Port in use: Close old terminal windows or run 'Stop-Owlin.bat' then re-run your desired 'Start-Owlin-*.bat' script.
