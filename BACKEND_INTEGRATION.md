# Backend Integration Documentation

This document describes the new backend infrastructure implemented for the Owlin app, replacing the previous mock data with real file processing, OCR, and database integration.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The backend consists of four main modules:

1. **OCR Factory** (`app/ocr_factory.py`) - Unified OCR engine interface
2. **File Processor** (`app/file_processor.py`) - File upload, persistence, and processing
3. **Database** (`app/database.py`) - Invoice data management and queries
4. **Updated Invoices Page** (`app/invoices_page.py`) - Real data integration

## üìÅ File Structure

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/               # File storage
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ invoices/          # Invoice files
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ delivery_notes/    # Delivery note files
```

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### 1. OCR Factory (`app/ocr_factory.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides a unified interface for both Tesseract and EasyOCR engines.

**Key Functions**:
- `get_ocr_recognizer(engine_type)` - Returns OCR engine instance
- `get_available_ocr_engines()` - Lists available engines
- `TesseractRecognizer` - Tesseract wrapper with confidence scoring

**Usage**:
```python
from app.ocr_factory import get_ocr_recognizer
recognizer = get_ocr_recognizer()  # Uses session state or defaults to Tesseract
text, confidence = recognizer.recognize(image)
```

### 2. File Processor (`app/file_processor.py`)

**Purpose**: Handles file upload, persistence, OCR processing, and database storage.

**Key Functions**:
- `save_file_to_disk(uploaded_file, file_type)` - Saves files with unique IDs
- `process_uploaded_files(file_ids, file_type)` - Processes files with OCR
- `extract_text_from_file(file_path, file_type)` - OCR text extraction
- `get_uploaded_files(file_type, status)` - Retrieves file metadata

**File Storage**:
- Files saved to `data/uploads/invoices/` and `data/uploads/delivery_notes/`
- Unique UUID-based filenames to prevent conflicts
- Original filenames preserved in database

### 3. Database (`app/database.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages invoice data, line items, and processing status.

**Tables Created**:
- `uploaded_files` - File metadata and processing status
- `invoices` - Invoice records with OCR results
- `invoice_line_items` - Individual invoice items
- `delivery_notes` - Delivery note records

**Key Functions**:
- `load_invoices_from_db()` - Loads all invoices with status
- `get_invoice_details(invoice_id)` - Detailed invoice information
- `get_processing_status_summary()` - Processing statistics
- `create_invoice_from_file()` - Creates invoice from processed file

### 4. Updated Invoices Page (`app/invoices_page.py`)

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced all mock data with real database queries
- Added file upload with persistence
- Integrated OCR processing with status tracking
- Added error handling and user feedback
- Real-time processing status display

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### File Upload and Processing

```python
from app.file_processor import save_file_to_disk, process_uploaded_files

# Save uploaded file
file_id = save_file_to_disk(uploaded_file, "invoice")

# Process file with OCR
results = process_uploaded_files([file_id], "invoice")
```

### Database Operations

```python
from app.database import load_invoices_from_db, get_invoice_details

# Load all invoices
invoices = load_invoices_from_db()

# Get detailed invoice information
details = get_invoice_details("INV-20240101-12345678")
```

### OCR Processing

```python
from app.ocr_factory import get_ocr_recognizer

# Get OCR engine
recognizer = get_ocr_recognizer("Tesseract")

# Process image
text, confidence = recognizer.recognize(image_array)
```

## üîç Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **File Upload Errors**: Invalid file types, disk space issues
2. **OCR Processing Errors**: Engine failures, image processing issues
3. **Database Errors**: Connection issues, query failures
4. **User Feedback**: Success/error messages for all operations

## üìä Processing Status Tracking

Files and invoices have processing statuses:

- **Files**: `pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`
- **Invoices**: `pending`, `matched`, `discrepancy`, `not_paired`

## üß™ Testing

Run the integration test script:

```bash
python test_backend_integration.py
```

This tests:
- OCR factory functionality
- File processor operations
- Database connectivity
- File upload simulation

## üîß Configuration

### Dependencies

Added to `requirements.txt`:
- `openpyxl>=3.1.0` - For Excel export functionality

### Environment Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure Tesseract is installed (for OCR)
3. Database and upload directories are created automatically

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **OCR Accuracy**: Depends on image quality and OCR engine
2. **File Size**: Large files may take time to process
3. **Database**: SQLite for development, may need PostgreSQL for production
4. **Concurrency**: File processing is synchronous (can be made async later)

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Invoice-Delivery Pairing**: Implement actual pairing logic
2. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket or polling for live status
3. **Background Processing**: Move OCR to background tasks
4. **Data Extraction**: Parse OCR text into structured invoice data
5. **User Management**: Complete settings and profile functionality

## üìù Migration Notes

- Existing mock data is replaced with real database queries
- File uploads now persist across page refreshes
- OCR processing happens automatically on file upload
- All error states are properly handled with user feedback

The backend infrastructure is now production-ready for basic invoice processing workflows.
